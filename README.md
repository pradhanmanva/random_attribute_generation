**This is a ML Assignment 2 Bonus.**

There are 4 Python files in this project.
	1. binary_tree.py - for the data structure
	2. decision_tree - for generating the results
	3. id3.py - for entropy-based ID3 function
	4. random_generator.py - for random attribute selection

The `binary_tree.py` contains the data structure with node, node-> right, node->left, etc along with the accessor functions. It also contain other functions used to do other jobs.

The `decision_tree.py` is used to display the results and contains the `main()` function. It uses the other `.py` files.

The `id3.py` contains the ID3 method for creating the decision tree.

The `random_generator.py`contains the Random attribute selection method for creating the decision tree.
